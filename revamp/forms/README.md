2. **Rename the file** to be simple and clear.
   - **Good Name:** `Volunteer-Form.pdf`
   - **Bad Name:** `Vol Form Final Version 2 (1).pdf`
   - **Rule:** Use dashes `-` instead of spaces.
3. **Upload the file** into this `forms` folder.

## After Uploading
Once the file is here, you (or the web developer) can link to it on the website using the address:
`forms/Your-File-Name.pdf`
