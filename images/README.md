# How to Add Images

This folder is for pictures used on the website pages (like the logo, banners, or side photos).

## How to Add an Image
1. **Prepare your image**.
   - Make sure it is a **JPG** or **PNG** file.
   - Try to keep the file size small (under 500KB is best) so the website loads fast.
2. **Rename the file**.
   - **Good Name:** `front-building.jpg`
   - **Bad Name:** `IMG_2025.jpg` (Hard to know what it is)
   - **Rule:** Use dashes `-` instead of spaces. No special characters like `&` or `%`.
3. **Upload the file** into this `images` folder.

## Organizing
- If you have many photos for a specific event, you can make a new folder inside here (e.g., `images/christmas-party/`) and put them there.
