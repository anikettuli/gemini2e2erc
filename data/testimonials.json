The 2-E2 Eyeglass Recycling Center is the main provider of our eyeglasses. It has literally allowed us to serve hundreds of villagers who currently have no access to screenings and prescription eyeglasses and reading glasses.",

What an honor and privilege it's been to witness thousands of people, literally, obtain a \"clear\" view of their world as demonstrated by the accompanying thousands of smiles. Many, if not the majority, often receive glasses for the first time through this ministry. Whether it was a 60 year old man I remember who after obtaining glasses, celebrated the occasion by riding his bike around like a child or, most recently, a woman who obtained glasses for the first time on her 102nd birthday, none of this would happen if not for the folks at the Lions Recycle Center who take the time to receive, process, and refurbish these glasses. Because of the Lion's Center, I have been able to help meet someone's need which provided the opportunity to share the love of Jesus!",

We test for Rx with a simple refractor set to determine the correct diopter. This method enables us to see about 200 patients per day. Clinics take place in churches or outside under the trees.",

We take 30-40 people on our team, and around 5-8 serve in our vision clinic. Those clinics serve about 200-300 people daily (combined). We could do NONE of this without the generous support of the Lions and the recycled eyeglasses ministry. We are completely dependent on you as partners. And you guys are so excellent and make it easy to help! You work hard to fulfill our orders, which I know to be heavy quantities…",
