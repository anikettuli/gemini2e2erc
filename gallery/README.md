# How to Add Gallery Photos

This folder is specifically for the "Photo Gallery" page on the website.

## How to Add Photos to the Gallery
1. **Select your best photos**. You don't need to upload every single one!
2. **Rename them** (Optional but helpful).
   - Example: `sorting-glasses-1.jpg`, `sorting-glasses-2.jpg`.
   - **Rule:** No spaces in filenames. Use dashes `-`.
3. **Upload the files** into this `gallery` folder.

## Note
Currently, the website might need a small code update to "see" the new photos you add here. Let the web developer know when you have uploaded a new batch of photos.
